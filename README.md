# Zero-Shot Classification

This project provides a generic implementation of a zero-shot text classification system. It is designed to be adaptable to different domains and types of data, allowing classification of texts into user-defined categories without the need for supervised training on specific classes.

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd zero-shot-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Place your text files in the `data/raw` folder. Use functions in `src/data_processing.py` to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Zero-Shot Classification:** Use the `src/classifier.py` module to perform zero-shot classification on your texts, defining the labels or categories you want to classify.

3. **Exploration and Experimentation:** Utilize the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the functionality and test the classifier with different datasets and scenarios.

4. **Testing:** Run the unit tests in the `tests/` folder to verify the correctness of the code.
