# Zero-Shot Text Classification

This project provides a framework for performing **zero-shot classification** on text data, allowing you to assign categories to text without needing task-specific training.  
It is designed to be flexible, enabling classification for a wide variety of domains such as social media content, customer feedback, product reviews, or news articles.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd zero-shot-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation
Place your raw text data in the data/raw directory. The data cleaning and preprocessing will be handled in the src/data_cleaning.py script.

Data Cleaning and Analysis
Use the Jupyter Notebook in notebooks/data_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb for exploratory data analysis and to visualize the cleaning process.

Model Inference / API Requests
The src/api_requests.py script contains functions to interact with APIs or models that perform zero-shot classification.

Visualization
Use the functions in src/visualization.py to create charts and graphs of classification results or data insights.

Testing
Run the tests in tests/test_data_cleaning.py to ensure data cleaning works as expected.
